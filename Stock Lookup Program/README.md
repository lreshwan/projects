Program that reads in stocks from a json file and their attributes (Ticker, Exchange Code, Company Name, Creation Date) and allows for lookup of these stocks by either ticker or exchange code. Also allows for adding or removing other stocks to the list and then choosing to save those stocks to the list at the end and export back to the json file or to not save the changes and keep the json file the same. A properly formatted json file is given.
